    <h3>This recipe is so simple, but I hope you give it a try and love it!</h3>
    <h4><strong>INGREDIENTS</strong></h4>
    <UL>
        <LI>1 heaping cup organic frozen mixed berries</LI>
        <LI>1 small ripe banana (sliced and frozen)</LI>
        <LI>2-3 Tbsp light coconut or almond milk (plus more as needed)</LI>
    </UL>
    <h4><strong>TOPPINGS</strong></h4>
    <ul>
        <li>1 Tbsp shredded unsweetened coconut (desiccated)</li>
        <li>1 Tbsp chia seeds</li>
        <li>1 Tbsp hemp seeds</li>
        <li>Granola (optional)</li>
        <li>Fruit (optional)</li>
    </ul>
    <h4><strong>INSTRUCTIONS</strong></h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Add frozen berries and banana to a blender and blend on low until small bits remain.</li>
        <li>Add a bit of coconut or almond milk and protein powder (optional), and blend on low again, scraping down sides as needed, until the mixture reaches a soft serve consistency.</li>
        <li>Scoop into 1-2 serving bowls (amount as original recipe is written // adjust if altering batch size) and top with desired toppings (optional). I prefer chia seeds, hemp seeds, and coconut, but strawberries, granola, and a nut or seed butter would be great here, too!</li>
        <li>Best when fresh, though leftovers keep in the freezer for 1-2 weeks. Let thaw before enjoying.</li>
    </ol>
